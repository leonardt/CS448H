Designing hardware is becoming a hot topic again. At one level,
platforms like the Arduino and the Maker Movement have generated
great interest in building new kinds of computing devices.  At
another level, major companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and
Amazon are increasingly launching major hardware design efforts.
They are finding they can build unique products which combine
innovative hardware with software. However, hardware design is still
difficult and expensive, as evidenced by the fact that there are
relatively few hardware startups compared to software startups.

The goal of this course is to explore different approaches for
making it easier to design hardware. In particular, tools inspired
by Agile Software Design which encourages rapid experimentation and
fast prototyping.  We will assume no previous experience in hardware
design; the course will teach you how to program FPGAs from scratch.
We will use the Lattice Icestick, an $22 FPGA board that you can program
from your laptop (one will be provided). This board uses the Lattice
ICE40 fpga, which is the only FPGA with an open source tool chain.
Projects in the course will involve building new tools that make
it fast and easy to program this FPGA.

This course is targeted to systems and graphics students interested
in learning more about hardware design.  No previous hardware design
experience is required, although experience with platforms like the
Arduino is a plus. We encourage students with a strong software
background and no hardware experience to take the course.
It may  be taken for 3-4 credits.  Two individual short programming
assignments and a team-based final project must be completed.

Note the first class will be on Thu Jan 12th.
